# Emotion recognition

The plan is to build a website that detects the emotion you're feeling. It could be neutral, happy, sad, angry, suprised, etc... It will work by using your webcam.

Interesting things could be done, such as:

- Tracking my emotions over time as I watch a movie
- Periodically evaluate my emotion and see how it evolves throughout the day
- If there are multiple people, try to recognize the emotions of everyone
- Avoid getting fooled by printed pictures or non-human things
